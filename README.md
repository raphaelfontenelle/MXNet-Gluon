# Artificial Intelligence
## Codes developed in this tutorial

This repository was used to detect pose of soccer game. 

Topics:
- Predict with pre-trained AlphaPose Estimation models
- Load a pretrained model
- Pre-process an image for detector, and make inference
- Process tensor from detector to keypoint network
- Predict with a Alpha Pose network
- Display the pose estimation results
